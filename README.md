# my-screeps-ai
My AI for the game [Screeps](https://screeps.com) using TypeScript.
This project is in very early development so I don't recommend using this code in your own colony.

## Building
If you _really_ want to compile and use it, the build instructions are found in the [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter).
